# Hands-On Exercise 2 - DQL Optimizations

When using DQL with a customer, you may be asked questions like:
- _"What are the most expensive queries in my environment?"_
- _"How can I make my query run faster?"_

This section focuses on applying the principles of query optimization to scenarios you may encounter with a customer.
